This is the post about the video various paths in web development and in many ways I found this advice to be a pleasant surprise as I'm further along in my learning journey than I had thought.  
 
One piece of advice that I thought was particularly valuable was testing. There are many approaches to testing, and I see value in creating a strong test. In Ruby I used testing with a gem called  Rspec and while completing  Watch and Code, a JavaScript tutorial that focuses on Vanilla JavaScript (Javascript without frameworks) there is a module about not worrying about the things a debugger can tell you focusing on the Chrome Debugger, and for JavaScript, the route I'm most likely taking, there is Grunt and Gulp.  Learning this step and building a strong testing foundation early in the app should provide for more robust and quality code.
