<h1>More tinkering</h1>
<h3><i>June 05, 2017</i></h3>
<p>I’ve finished the tutorial. Now for a small list of a few little refinements I <em>could</em> make in the future that are curently deliberate features in the site.</p>

<p>Bottom menu:
Turn the ‘Blog’ item back into a link (unlike the top where it is a drop-down-menu). Alternativly, I could try my hand at a drop-up menu.</p>

<p>Responsive design:
Change ‘Blog’ on both bottom and top into a link back to my ‘/blog’ index page.</p>

<p>Comments:
As I’ve blogged about previously, adding comments would help complete everything.</p>

<p>Social Media Links:
Reposition github to to the bottom and make it a little bigger, the porportion is off.</p>

<p>Blog Posts:
At some point my blog title list broke and is now hanging out on the left side of the page, even though it’s aligned for the right side.</p>
